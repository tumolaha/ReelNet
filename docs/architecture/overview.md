# ReelNet Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

ReelNet follows a modern microservices architecture with the following key components:

### Core Components

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - React-based SPA
   - WebSocket client for real-time features
   - Redux for state management
   - Video processing capabilities

2. **Backend Services**
   - Authentication Service
   - Project Management Service
   - Collaboration Service
   - Video Processing Service
   - Social Features Service

3. **Data Layer**
   - PostgreSQL for persistent data
   - Redis for caching and real-time data
   - S3 for video storage

4. **Infrastructure**
   - AWS Cloud infrastructure
   - Docker containerization
   - Kubernetes orchestration

## System Interactions

```
[Frontend App] <---> [API Gateway]
                        |
    +-------------------+-------------------+
    |                   |                   |
[Auth Service]  [Project Service]  [Video Service]
    |                   |                   |
[User DB]        [Project DB]       [Video Storage]
```

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
2. **API Design**: RESTful APIs with GraphQL for complex queries
3. **Real-time**: WebSocket for live collaboration
4. **Storage**: Hybrid storage solution (S3 + CDN)

## Security Measures

- SSL/TLS encryption
- JWT authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling of services
- Load balancing
- Caching strategies
- Database sharding
- CDN integration
